ensures all new owners and tenants receive all relevant information regarding their rights, responsibilities, benefits and obligations of owning or living in a condominium unit; prohibits conflicts of

good care than non-profit or public facilities”; and\r\nWhereas the Ford Government acted faster to pass Bill 218, the Supporting Ontario’s Recovery and Municipal Elections Act 2020 and shield

the first and second waves of the pandemic with 30-year licences and millions of dollars in public funds;\r\nTherefore, the Legislative Assembly calls on the Ford government to place an indefinite moratorium on the issuing of new licences and the renewal of licences of for-profit long-term care providers and prioritize the development of not-for-profit long-term care in

and\r\nWhereas previous Liberal and Conservative governments ignored lessons from SARS, failed to maintain critical stockpiles of personal protective equipment (PPE) and allowed N95 masks and other vital protective equipment to expire without making any effort to replace them; and\r\nWhereas many of Ontario’s essential workers still have to fight for adequate personal protective equipment, and the Ford government forces workers in jobs with high risk of COVID-19 exposure to prove they contracted the disease on the job in order to receive WSIB supports; and\r\nWhereas the Ford government still has yet to provide a clear strategy to ensure vaccination of Ontario’s essential workers despite having more than a year to develop a plan;\r\nTherefore, the Legislative Assembly calls on the Ford government to better protect Ontario’s workers by legislating paid sick days, ensuring access to high-quality PPE, developing an effective essential worker vaccination strategy with paid time off for vaccination and extending full WSIB protections to all Ontario workers.","ayes":[{"full_name":"Jill Andrew","party":"NDP","riding":"Toronto-St. Paul's"},{"full_name":"Doly Begum","party":"NDP","riding":"Scarborough Southwest"},{"full_name":"Lucille Collard","party":"LIB","riding":"Ottawa-Vanier"},{"full_name":"John Fraser","party":"LIB","riding":"Ottawa South"},{"full_name":"Wayne Gates","party":"NDP","riding":"Niagara Falls"},{"full_name":"France Gélinas","party":"NDP","riding":"Nickel Belt"},{"full_name":"Lisa Gretzky","party":"NDP","riding":"Windsor West"},{"full_name":"Faisal Hassan","party":"NDP","riding":"York South-Weston"},{"full_name":"Andrea Horwath","party":"NDP","riding":"Hamilton Centre"},{"full_name":"Bhutila Karpoche","party":"NDP","riding":"Parkdale-High Park"},{"full_name":"Terence Kernaghan","party":"NDP","riding":"London North Centre"},{"full_name":"Mike Schreiner","party":"GRN","riding":"Guelph"},{"full_name":"Gurratan Singh","party":"NDP","riding":"Brampton East"},{"full_name":"Monique Taylor","party":"NDP","riding":"Hamilton Mountain"},{"full_name":"John Vanthof","party":"NDP","riding":"Timiskaming-Cochrane"},{"full_name":"Kevin Yarde","party":"Independent","riding":"Brampton North"}],"nays":[{"full_name":"Aris Babikian","party":"OPC","riding":"Scarborough-Agincourt"},{"full_name":"Paul Calandra","party":"OPC","riding":"Markham-Stouffville"},{"full_name":"Stan Cho","party":"OPC","riding":"Willowdale"},{"full_name":"Lorne Coe","party":"OPC","riding":"Whitby"},{"full_name":"Stephen Crawford","party":"OPC","riding":"Oakville"},{"full_name":"Rudy Cuzzetto","party":"OPC","riding":"Mississauga-Lakeshore"},{"full_name":"Christine Elliott","party":"OPC","riding":"Newmarket-Aurora"},{"full_name":"Merrilee Fullerton","party":"OPC","riding":"Kanata-Carleton"},{"full_name":"Christine Hogarth","party":"OPC","riding":"Etobicoke-Lakeshore"},{"full_name":"Vincent Ke","party":"OPC","riding":"Don Valley North"},{"full_name":"Stephen Lecce","party":"OPC","riding":"King-Vaughan"},{"full_name":"Lisa MacLeod","party":"OPC","riding":"Nepean"},{"full_name":"Robin Martin","party":"OPC","riding":"Eglinton-Lawrence"},{"full_name":"Jane McKenna","party":"OPC","riding":"Burlington"},{"full_name":"Christina Maria Mitas","party":"OPC","riding":"Scarborough Centre"},{"full_name":"Caroline Mulroney","party":"OPC","riding":"York-Simcoe"},{"full_name":"Billy Pang","party":"OPC","riding":"Markham-Unionville"},{"full_name":"Lindsey Park","party":"Independent","riding":"Durham"},{"full_name":"David Piccini","party":"OPC","riding":"Northumberland-Peterborough South"},{"full_name":"Kaleed Rasheed","party":"OPC","riding":"Mississauga East-Cooksville"},{"full_name":"Jeremy Roberts","party":"OPC","riding":"Ottawa West-Nepean"},{"full_name":"Sheref Sabawy","party":"OPC","riding":"Mississauga-Erin Mills"},{"full_name":"Amarjot Sandhu","party":"OPC","riding":"Brampton West"},{"full_name":"Prabmeet Singh Sarkaria","party":"OPC","riding":"Brampton South"},{"full_name":"Dave Smith","party":"OPC","riding":"Peterborough-Kawartha"},{"full_name":"Nina Tangri","party":"OPC","riding":"Mississauga-Streetsville"},{"full_name":"Vijay Thanigasalam","party":"OPC","riding":"Scarborough-Rouge Park"},{"full_name":"Michael A.
